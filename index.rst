Welcome to ASGARD's Broker Network documentation!
=================================================

Beginning from the Version 2.14.0 of the ASGARD Management Center, you
can install a Broker Network in your environment (a special license is
needed for this feature). This is designed to be your gateway which is
placed in front of the ASGARD. You can use this for multiple Scenarios:

- Multiple Brokers for load balancing
- Multiple Brokers for load sharing
- Internet facing Broker for remote clients
- DMZ facing Broker

In the following chapters we will describe how to set this network up.
